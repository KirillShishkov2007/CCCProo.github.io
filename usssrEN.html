<h1> Ruble from 1988 to UNKNOWN </h1>
<p> The ruble is the currency of the USSR from 1923 to December 26, 1991, and after that date - the currency of some states that arose after the collapse of the Soviet Union (in particular, in Tajikistan before January 8, 1994). Until 1947, it had a parallel circulation with the chervonets.

Most of the Soviet banknotes were designed by the engraver and artist Ivan Ivanovich Dubasov.

In the USSR, from November 1923 to February 1924, all paper banknotes were called State banknotes of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics. From 1924 to 1991, banknotes in denominations of up to 10 rubles (one chervonets) were called the State Treasury Notes of the USSR, from 10 rubles and above - the Tickets of the State Bank of the USSR. Since 1991, banknotes of all denominations have been called the Tickets of the State Bank of the USSR.

The Soviet ruble after the monetary reform on January 1, 1961 was formally equal to 0.987412 g of gold. Gold in the USSR could be purchased in the form of jewelry, which in 1985 was sold in the amount of 2.926 billion rubles, and commemorative gold coins were issued. The State Bank of the USSR established the official exchange rate of the ruble in relation to other currencies, so, on December 25, 1991, 1 US dollar was equal to 0.5571 rubles, 1 pound sterling - 1.0389 rubles [3].

After the collapse of the USSR in 1992-1995, the Soviet ruble was gradually withdrawn from circulation. The last country to abandon the Soviet ruble was Tajikistan (January 8, 1994). Russia withdrew from the Soviet ruble zone in July 1993. </p>
