<h1> What is the BSSR </h1>
<p> BSSR </p>

<P> Byelorussian Soviet Socialist Republic (Byelorussian SSR, Byelorussian SSR; Byelorussian Savetskaya Satsyyalistychnaya Respublika) - a union republic within the USSR from 1922 to 1991. </p>
<p> It was first proclaimed on January 1, 1919 under the name of the Socialist Soviet Republic of Belarus, which left the RSFSR on January 31, 1919, and on February 27 merged with the Lithuanian Soviet Republic into the Lithuanian-Belarusian Soviet Socialist Republic - Litbel. </p>
<p> Litbel ceased to exist as a result of the Polish occupation during the Soviet-Polish war. On July 12, 1920, as a result of the Moscow Treaty concluded between the RSFSR and Lithuania, Litbel ceased to exist. On July 31, 1920, the Socialist Soviet Republic of Belarus (Belarusian Socialist Soviet Republic) was restored in Minsk, which later changed its name to the Belarusian Socialist Soviet Republic (with the adoption of the USSR Constitution of 1936, the second and third words were reversed). The BSSR, among the 4 Soviet republics, signed the Treaty on the formation of the USSR on December 30, 1922. </p>
<p> Along with the Ukrainian SSR, she was a sovereign co-founder and member of the UN since 1945. </p>
<p> On July 27, 1990, the Declaration on State Sovereignty of the BSSR was adopted. On September 19, 1991, the BSSR was renamed the Republic of Belarus, and on December 8, 1991, together with representatives of the RSFSR and Ukraine, the leadership of the republic signed the Belovezhskaya agreement on the creation of the CIS. </p>
